FCFS seems better for largers processes that are all about the same size while RR is better for a large amount of
smaller processes. RR is also better when the first to arrive is large.

FCFS -> FCFS will be better when the jobs are all about the same size.
RR -> when a larger job is the first to arrive, RR should preform better.

If the burst times were less than the quantum it would be a FCFS algorithm. Solving this would involve lowering 
the quantum
